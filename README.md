## Third assignment for my "Software Engineering" course. Developed by me and a colleague.

This is a Server app made for [Wine Ecommerce](https://github.com/Sclafus/Wine-Ecommerce).

It's using:
* Client-Server architecture (with JDBC)
* SQL Database (MySQL)

This program is the Server of the architecture (clearly). 

The Client application is available [here](https://github.com/Sclafus/Ecommerce-GUI).
